Temporarily disable all VPNs, Hamachi, Antiviruses, and firewalls (especially third-party firewalls).</h6>They are known for blocking game connections. We do not know what third-party firewalls you have installed; you need to use an online search engine such as Google to find instructions on how to disable them. Make sure to uninstall incompatible software as well; <a href=\"https://minecrafthopper.net/help/known-incompatible-software/\">click here</a> to find a list of them.<br/><br/><h6>2. Whitelist the game's JREs (Java Runtime Environment) on your operating system's firewall settings.</h6>If Windows Firewall has blocked Minecraft's Internet access, the connection failure will occur. You can temporarily disable the firewall as mentioned above or whitelist the game to see if that's the case. If you do not know how to whitelist a game on your firewall settings on Windows, do the following:<br/><br/><b>If you are using Silent Client:</b><ol><li>Press the Windows Key and type \"firewall.\"</li><li>Click on \"Allow an app through Windows Firewall.\"</li><li>Click on \"Allow another app...\"</li><li>Click Browse, then navigate to: <br/><code>%appdata%\\.minecraft\\.silentclient\\bin\\javaw.exe</code></li><li>Click Open, then Add.</li><li>Click OK and open Silent Client again.</li></ol><br/><b>If you are using Vanilla Minecraft:</b><ol><li>Press the Windows Key and type \"firewall.\"</li><li>Click on \"Allow an app through Windows Firewall.\"</li><li>Click on \"Allow another app...\"</li><li>Click Browse, then navigate to: <br/><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Minecraft\\runtime\\java-runtime-alpha\\windows-x64\\java-runtime-alpha\\bin\\javaw.exe</code></li><li>Click Open, then Add.</li><li>Click OK and open Minecraft again.</li></ol><br/><h6>3. Try on another connection, such as mobile data via wireless hotspot or USB tethering.</h6>If this option fixes the problem, your network connection might have some problems. In that case, we suggest running a network troubleshooter.<br/><br/><h6>4. Try refreshing your network settings.</h6>If you do not know how to do it, follow the instructions below:<ol><li>Press the <b>Windows Key</b>, then type <code>cmd</code>.</li><li>Under 'Command Prompt,' click <b>Run as administrator</b></li><li>Type <code>netsh winsock reset</code> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Type <code>netsh int ip reset</code> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Type <code>ipconfig /release</code> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Type <code>ipconfig /renew</code> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Type <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li></ol><br/>Additionally, do the following:<ol><li>Press the <b>Windows Key</b>, then type <code>cmd</code>.</lI><li>Under 'Command Prompt,' click <b>Run as administrator</b></lI><li>Type <code>netsh interface tcp show global</code> and press Enter.</lI><li>If Receive-Side Scaling State is disabled, type <code>netsh interface tcp set global rss=enabled</code> and press enter.</lI><li>If \"Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level\" is disabled, type <code>netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal</code> and press enter.</lI></ol><br/><br/><h3 id=\"two\">Fixing \"Failed to log in: null.\"</h3>The error is often caused by Microsoft accounts being under the minimum age requirement or by misconfigured Microsoft/Xbox privacy settings.<br/><br/><h6>1.

Remove illegal non-premium account tools.</h6>This connection issue is likely caused by using illegal or incompatible software, which is known to corrupt your hosts list by redirecting any Mojang authentification server address to their own illicit servers. To fix this, you need to remove non-official software; then, you must fix your affected hosts file.<br/><br/>If you have used third-party authenticators like \"MCLeaks\", \"TheAltening\", \"EasyMC\", or anything similar on your computer, you need to switch back to the Mojang/Microsoft authenticator through the third-party authenticator you used and then uninstall it from the computer.<br/><br/>Once you have done that, you need to restore your system's hosts file.
