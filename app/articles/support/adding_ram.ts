	We all love to play Minecraft, especially when using high-resolution resource packs and shaders, but using such resources in Minecraft makes it power-hungry. It consumes a lot of memory (RAM) on your computer. If your game does not have enough memory allocated to it, its frames (FPS) may decrease, and you might start experiencing lag spikes (FPS drops), it may load slowly, and sometimes it might even crash. If you start experiencing any of the mentioned problems, you should consider using the built-in option to change the amount of allocated memory.

	<h3>How can I add more memory to Minecraft on the Silent Client launcher?</h3>
	<span style="color:red">Note:</span> we do not suggest allocating more than half of the available memory. You should keep the allocated memory between 2-4 GB, depending on how much total RAM your computer has.<br/><br/>
	If you want to change the amount of allocated memory, you need to do the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Open the Silent Client launcher and click the "Settings" button, as shown in the screenshot below.
