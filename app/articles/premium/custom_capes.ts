	<h3>Uploading and using Custom Capes</h3>
	To download a Custom Cape, click the "Create Custom Cape" button and fill in all the fields.
	Attention! We are using our own template for cape textures, click the "Tutorial" button to read more. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Afterward, you'll have to wait for a staff member to approve or deny your cape</span>.
	<br/><br/>
	If your Custom Cape is denied, a message saying "Rejected" will show up on the cape board, preventing you from using it.
	<br/><br/>
	If your custom cape is approved, you will be able to select it from the cosmetics menu.
