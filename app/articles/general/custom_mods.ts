	No, you can't do it. Silent Client is a Minecraft client that includes a variety of custom-coded mods, FPS boosting features, custom cosmetics, and many more unique features. All mods and features need to be coded by hand by our developers (except a few which the original developer gave approval to us), which means that you won't be able to add mods on your own.
<br/><br/>
This also means that you cannot use Silent Client with Forge as the mods were coded for Silent Client and not Forge.`,
